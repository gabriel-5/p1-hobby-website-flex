design concept:

this website is presented as a "fan page" dedicated to the country music group "the carter family" (1st generation). the information and music is all fictional, but i liked this as a framing device that went on to help think through the visual identity of the website. it is in some ways anachronistic, with the unserious font and incongruous image choices - but i wanted to referencec this kind of semi-lost design style whilst remaining highly functional and clean. trying to capture the sense of fun and mystery of old websites without any of the chaos. 

i knew that i wanted the website to have a T-shaped structure for all the pages, with an image in the left, navigation links on the right side and the main content going down the middle. i chose to keep all the elements small, so that the website would be as readable for users on lower-resolution laptop screens as it is on high-resolution ones. 

design-wise, i have a strong preferance for websites which display all the information in one place, with minimal need for scrolling, use of drop-down menus or objects that expand and contract. i find this kind of visual-shuffling around when using websites very disorientating and quite an unfriendly user experience. although the choice to have the main content of the website in a small strip in the middle does mean that on some displays the user will need to scroll down to view it all, i kept the logo images and navigation links in fixed positions, so that when scrolling down it still feels grounded (didn't want it to feel like one of those semi-infinite scroller scam sites).

problems to be fixed:

- mobile version is dodgy but does the job
- html audio player is ugly but will implement some kind of js solution later on; poss click on small images in a grid to stop/start audio
