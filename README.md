mostly fictional fan page for country music legends "the carter family" (1st generation) with fake music and info - using as dumping ground for quick musical ideas in case there is anything to salvage

problems to be fixed:

- mobile version is dodgy but does the job
- html audio player is ugly but will implement some kind of js solution later on; poss click on small images in a grid to stop/start audio
