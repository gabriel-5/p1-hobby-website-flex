design concept:

this website is presented as a "fan page" dedicated to the country music group "the carter family" (1st generation). the information and music hosted is all fictional, but i liked this as a framing device that went on to help me think through the visual style of the website. 

i knew that i wanted the website to have a T-shaped structure for all the pages, with an image in the left, navigation links on the right side and the main content going down the middle. i chose to keep all the elements small, so that all the content would remain in view for lower resolution screens.

design-wise, i have a strong preference for websites which display all the information in one place, with minimal need for scrolling, use of drop-down menus or objects that expand and contract. i find this kind of visual-shuffling around when using websites very disorientating and quite an unfriendly user experience. i kept the logo images and navigation links in fixed positions, so that when scrolling down it still feels grounded (didn't want it to feel like one of those semi-infinite scroller scam sites).

problems to be fixed:

- mobile version is dodgy but does the job
- html audio player is ugly but will implement some kind of js solution later on; poss click on small images in a grid to stop/start audio
